Just saw [The Brothers Grimm][1] yesterday. It was a \*special\* movie <img src="http://i2.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

It&#8217;s about the 2 brothers Will and Jake, lots of &#8220;fairy tales&#8221; in it, if not with a certain twist to it <img src="http://xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?w=625" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />  
Had its boring parts but it kept you going and made me laugh a few times.  
Ending was not so great but good enough.
