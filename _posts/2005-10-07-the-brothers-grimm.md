Just saw [The Brothers Grimm][1] yesterday. It was a \*special\* movie :smile: 

It&#8217;s about the 2 brothers Will and Jake, lots of &#8220;fairy tales&#8221; in it, if not with a certain twist to it :wink:  
Had its boring parts but it kept you going and made me laugh a few times.  
Ending was not so great but good enough.
