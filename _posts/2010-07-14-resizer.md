I've been working on a little project to demo the features of [Vidyano][1].[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" title="Resizer Preview" src="https://i1.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/PreviewResizer.png?resize=620%2C527" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />][2]

It's used internally to generate the thumbnails for our [Wiki][3]. The source code is available on [codeplex][4] and the application is deployed as [click-once][5].

I'll be talking about the specific Vidyano features and the resizing part with WPF 4 in the next blog posts.
