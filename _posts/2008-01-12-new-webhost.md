Well actually it&#8217;s a VPS (Virtual Private Server), I can now do whatever I want with it. Yes, I can even make it crash completely (been there done that).

I&#8217;ve got 256MB of memory for myself, and 10GB of storage. Have installed Ubuntu 7.10 on it and got LiteSpeed running (using Rails was never this easy).

My blog is currently running on it <img src="http://i2.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />
