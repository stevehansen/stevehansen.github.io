With each Visual Studio version we get more and more useful keyboard shortcuts, I know there are a lot of cheat sheets posters, etc but wouldn&#8217;t it be easier that they are just shown while you are working in Visual Studio.

That&#8217;s what IntelliCommand does, whenever you press the Ctrl, Shift, Alt combinations for more then 2 seconds (configurable) you&#8217;ll get a popup that shows the available shortcuts. It even works for those double shortcuts like Ctrl+K, Ctrl+D.

Some screenshots:

Get it from the [Visual Studio Gallery][3] or just download inside Visual Studio in the Tools and Extensions Manager.
