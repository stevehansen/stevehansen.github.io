I&#8217;m proud to announce that our team has finished our next major version of Vidyano.  
Build from scratch to optimize everything for the latest .NET 4.0 release and using all latest features of it (MEF, Rx, &#8230;).  
The User Interface now uses a MVVM based architecture with our Module/Page system on top of it.

You can download it directly from inside Visual Studio using the Extension Manager or at the [Visual Studio Gallery Page][1].
