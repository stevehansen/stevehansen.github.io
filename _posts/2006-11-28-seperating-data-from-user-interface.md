A few days ago a friend of mine asked me the following. He was working on a program with a database backend. He found some ORM tools on the web, but every time they worked differently (use that or that class, mapping files, configurations, &#8230;) and he was worried that if he took the wrong ORM tool that later on in the program they would be stuck with it.

So he asked me if I knew anything where this wouldn&#8217;t be the case. I was pretty busy at the moment but I told him that I would let him know anything in a few days.

Anybody that had the same problem before and has a good solution for it?
