After finishing my first year in Japanese, I decided to continue with a second year. I&#8217;ll actually be starting in 3rd year because we finished our beak in one year and the new school normally takes 2 years to finish the first book.

<a title="Amazon: Japanese for Busy People" href="http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Busy-People-I-Text/dp/4770018827" target="_blank">Amazon: Japanese for Busy People</a> is the book we have used. I hope the second year will be as fun and challenging as last year.
