Just found a pretty cool program today.  
It&#8217;s called MusicBrainz Tagger ([Website][1])

The great thing about this program is that it uses an online dictionary (based on some sort of hashing) to detect the files.  
It can set the MP3 tags but it can also rename/move the files.

Together with Album Art Fixer this can really clean up your music collection. ([Art Fixer Website][2])
