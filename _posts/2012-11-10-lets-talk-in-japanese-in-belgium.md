For other people in the Antwerp area, next week (17th of November) we have the next Nihongo Hanasoukai (日本語を話そう会). It&#8217;s organised each month and it&#8217;s for both native Japanese speakers and people learning Japanese. It&#8217;s just 2 hours and costs you € 1 but gives you the opportunity to test and practice speaking Japanese.

I went last month for the first time and it was really fun. They showed us first the different names for the moon (new moon, etc). We were then placed in groups of 3-4 and then we have to make sentences with adjectives. Each group had to read out the sentences they created and afterwards we had a few minutes to just talk about random stuff.
