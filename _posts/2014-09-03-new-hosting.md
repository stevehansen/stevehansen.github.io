After 9 years of using WordPress, I've finally decided to use another hosting. This time not just a new host/server but actually another technology to host my blog.

<a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> allows you to host a static pages based blog. You have complete <a href="https://github.com/stevehansen/stevehansen.github.io">version control/history</a>, but no overhead any more from php/mysql.

# Tools
* <a href="http://disqus.com/admin/create/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>: For still allowing comments, has a plugin for WordPress (Disqus Comment System) to move existing comments.
* <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter" target="_blank">WordPress to Jekyll Exporter</a>: Exports all posts/pages and converts them to markdown files for Jekyll.
* <a href="https://github.com/madhur/PortableJekyll" target="_blank">PortableJekyll</a>: the portable version contains everything which is required to run Jekyll v2.3 on Windows.
* <a href="https://windows.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Windows</a>: Git GUI client for Windows.

# Usage
Having the Jekyll for Windows allows you to run your blog locally (jekyll serve --watch) so that you can test before pushing. This was very useful as all the used tools were new for me, yaml config files, jekyll templating, markdown posts.
