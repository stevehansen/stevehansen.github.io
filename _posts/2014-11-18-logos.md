Just in case I ever need it in the future.
Made my Logo's folder public so that I can easily get some logo's when I need them in the future.

The files are available as .png (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 and 256x256) and also as an .ico with all the different sizes.

Currently:

- JavaScript <https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js>
- HTML5 <http://www.w3.org/html/logo/>
