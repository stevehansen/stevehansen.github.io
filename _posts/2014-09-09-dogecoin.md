I've been using/buying Bitcoins for a long time, bought my first when they were only â‚¬ 2/BTC.

Now with the [announcement](https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin) of Paypal supporting Bitcoins I checked the prices again.
Finding a place to buy them isn't really hard any more, I can even buy them directly using my debit card, so I bought 1 BTC from [LiteBit.eu](https://litebit.eu/registration/nl/32748M8myk/).
The site also offers other digital currencies and one that stood out was Dogecoin, from the official [website](http://dogecoin.com/):

**What is Dogecoin?**

Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that enables you to easily send money online. Think of it as "the internet currency."

**What's with Dogecoin and the dog?**

"Doge" is our fun, friendly mascot! The Shiba Inu is a Japanese breed of dog that was popularized as an online meme and it represents Dogecoin.
