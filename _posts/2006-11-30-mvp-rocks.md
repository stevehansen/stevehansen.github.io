I&#8217;ve been working MVP for a day now and I just love it. Complete seperation of data and user interface. I&#8217;ve been creating 2 models, one built with Ado.NET (which sucks by the way) and one built with <a title="Hera" href="http://www.heraframework.com" target="_blank">Hera</a> (the ORM tool at work).

I found a few ways to implement MVP though. Some still have a reference from the View to the Presenter. I removed this reference by using events on the View that the Presenter listens on.

By using <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" target="_blank">Rhino.Mocks</a> I also created a complete test case for my presenter with a mocked View and Model to check that everything goes as it should.

This is actually the first program where I could test a program with a user interface <img src="http://i2.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

I&#8217;ll see that I can post some information later today and put up the code for anybody who wants it.
