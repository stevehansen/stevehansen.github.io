This is another must have extension for any Web developer using Visual Studio 2012. It is updated regularly (a lot, like weekly) and they keep adding support for all the latest Web related technologies (TypeScript was added within a week).

Once you have the extension installed it will add native support for LESS, TypeScript, CoffeeScript and it also contains a minifier for generated JavaScript/CSS.
