I finally got the demo online, you can download it at our <a href="http://forums.heraframework.com/index.php?showtopic=202" target="_blank">forums</a>. If you have installed all the required tools it should work without a problem. I&#8217;ve added an attached database file so just installing SqlServer 2005 Express would be enough to run the demo. To run the oracle part you&#8217;ll need to install ODP.NET. The current demo can connect to 2 different database servers just by changing 1 word <img src="http://i2.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The ADO.NET part only supports SqlServer though. You can also change 1 line of code to switch to a completly different model. The web project is just a starter to show that the MVP part can be used on any user interface.

So the current demo has 2 models and 2 view with one and the same presenter. There is also a test project which uses Rhino Mocks to mock both a view and model. The tests just define the workflow of the presenter and then I implemented it. If I ever add anything I&#8217;ll need to update the tests because even adding a new event will fail the test <img src="http://i2.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

The file is 2.35MB because of the embedded database but it&#8217;s really a nice example of a MVP application. It even includes a second MVP part for the import part. The actual model implementation are seperated in the Demo.Service.Hera project for an implementation with our Hera Application Framework. And a Demo.Service.AdoDotNet for an implementation with ADO.NET, the last one isn&#8217;t completly though. It&#8217;s mostly missing some features that would make the sample too complicated (concurreny, transactions, state tracking,&#8230;) but it works.
