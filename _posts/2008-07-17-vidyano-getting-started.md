David has made a complete step-by-step getting started for Vidyano.

You can get more information at [our blog][1].

The download contains the document as a .doc file or a .xps file, and it also contains the complete result so you can quickly check it out.

This is just the beginning, I&#8217;m currently working on a sample browser that should show more advanced scenarios in Vidyano (with full source code so you can check how it&#8217;s done) that should be available in a few days <img src="http://i2.wp.com/xiu.shoeke.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=625" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />
