David has made a complete step-by-step getting started for Vidyano.

You can get more information at [our blog][1].

The download contains the document as a .doc file or a .xps file, and it also contains the complete result so you can quickly check it out.

This is just the beginning, I&#8217;m currently working on a sample browser that should show more advanced scenarios in Vidyano (with full source code so you can check how it&#8217;s done) that should be available in a few days :smile:
