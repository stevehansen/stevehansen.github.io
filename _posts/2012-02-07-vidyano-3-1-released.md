Our team has been hard at work to release version 3.1

**What&#8217;s new:**

*   Searching has been completely redesigned so that a single text box can be used to search the query, or per column based searching
*   A Master-Detail view has been added that can show the attributes and a single query at the same time
*   More flags have been added to open a persistent object in edit mode, that it should stay in edit mode or that it has to be opened after creation
*   Tabs and groups have been separated so that more data can be defined for them (template/column count per tab, label/collapsible per group)
*   Feedback can be configured to be e-mailed automatically
*   The License screen has been redesigned
*   A Windows Azure screen has been added to enable automatic scaling based on a week schedule
*   Etc
